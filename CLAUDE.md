# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RiftReframe Website - A static marketing site for a League of Legends highlight auto-clipper tool (Overwolf app). The actual application code is not in this repository.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page with product features
- `privacy.html` - Privacy policy page
- `riot.txt` - Riot Games compliance file (placeholder)

## Development

This is a pure static HTML/CSS site with no build process, dependencies, or JavaScript. To preview:
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
- Use any local HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server`)

## Design System

- Background: `#1a1a2e`
- Accent color: `#00d9ff` (cyan)
- Max content width: 800px (index), 700px (privacy)
- Responsive design with inline CSS
